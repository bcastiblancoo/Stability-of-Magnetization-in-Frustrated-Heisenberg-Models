# Stability-of-Magnetization-in-Frustrated-Heisenberg-Models
Computation of staggered magnetization in 2D square and 3D simple-cubic Heisenberg antiferromagnets using Linear Spin-Wave Theory and Duffy-regularized Brillouin-zone integrals. Framework designed for extension to frustrated (J_1 - J_2)models.
