Some plots obtained from the simulations:

- Energy bands for the 2D square and 3D cubic lattices.
- Preliminary results in the frustrated magnetization scenario, including magnetization as a function of the frustrated parameter, phase diagrams, and plots on the singular term on the spin-wave corrections.
